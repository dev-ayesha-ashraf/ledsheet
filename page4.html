            <p><strong>FIELD REPLACEABLE LED LIGHTENGINE:</strong> is serviceable through the aperture with a Phillips
                screwdriver.</p>

            <p><strong>USAI CLASSIC WHITE LED COLOR TECHNOLOGY:</strong> is tightly binned for fixture-to-fixture color
                consistency within a 2-Step MacAdam’s Ellipse.</p>

            <p><strong>TRIM:</strong> Die cast aluminum beveled trim has a 3" aperture with a 1" regressed bevel and
                retains a glass lens.</p>

            <p><strong>HOUSING FT WITH -15- COLLAR EXTENDER:</strong> All housings feature Adaptable
                Apertures<sup>®</sup> which allow for field changes from trimless or millwork to trimmed with a simple
                component change with parts from USAI. Housings are fabricated of 20 ga. steel construction with thru
                wire J-box, 4 in 4 out at min. 90°C, #12 AWG thru branch circuit wiring. 1.5" collar extender accessory
                accepts up to 1.5" ceiling thickness maximum, adds 0.5" to overall housing height, and reduces light
                output by 20%. Housing weighs 4 lbs.</p>

            <p><strong>MOUNTING:</strong> BeveLED Mini overlap flange fixtures are designed for use in sheetrock,
                acoustical ceiling tile, and many other ceiling materials. Butterfly brackets and adjustable nailer
                bars, extendible 14" – 24", with integral nails are provided standard for attachment to building
                structure. Channel bars are optionally available for grid ceiling applications.</p>

            <p><strong>DOUBLER MOUNTING KITS:</strong> Use USAI’s optional Doubler kits for repeatable installations of
                fixture heads in pairs. Specify and order one doubler kit for every two fixtures that you intend to
                install in double head configuration. During installation, simply swap out existing housing brackets
                with the revised brackets with notched spacing provided in the doubler kit and mount with heavy duty
                mounting bars provided. Only available for specific housings. The kit provided for the FT, FTIC, and
                FTCP housings (B3-FT-DBX) allows trims to be placed with 7", 8", or 9" on center spacing. Doubler kits
                are not available for the NC1, NC1C, or NC1CP housings.</p>

                <h3>GUIDELINES FOR FIELD PAINTING OF TRIMS:</h3>
                <p>We strongly recommend that custom paint color be applied by the factory during manufacturing or the
                    “PR” primer option be chosen for field painting. If these options are not chosen, the following
                    guidelines must be followed. Please note that this will void the 1-year finish warranty.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Paint Selection: Choose paint that is suitable for the application and location
                        of the trim. Trims are tested to not exceed an operating temperature of 90°C, with a typical
                        operating temperature of approximately 50°C. The paint chosen must be suitable for continuous
                        operating temperature of 50°C. Paint must be supplied and furnished by the customer.</li>
                    <li>Surface Preparation: Prepare the trim surfaces according to the paint
                        manufacturer’s instructions.</li>
                    <li>Application Instructions: Apply paint only to the trim casting. Do not apply
                        paint to glass, mounting clips, or any other components. Any disassembly or modification to the
                        trim will void the trim warranty and may create unsafe operating conditions.</li>
                </ol>
